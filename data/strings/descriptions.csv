LTA_Epattcudi,SHIP,"The ship modification on record as the “Epattcud I” is less a functional ship and more a mess of loosely welded and oversized armor plates, sheet metal and flux coils, rigged to a set of barely burn-capable engine parts from a variety of ships.
Its reasonably competent flux systems barely accommodate its bulky frame and weapons mounts, though it has been rigged to support what amounts to a large ballistic turret.

First found floating above the Hegemony base of Ancyra, its crew out-of-supplies and fuel, the small hegemony patrol fleet that uncovered the ship decided to classify this strange ship design ethos as “Epattcud”, in an effort to make it easier for them to identify amid the rather immense variety and specification differences in off-blueprint or part-autofactoried ships. Though rumour states that in fact the name originated as a joke, aimed at the dubiously viable construction of the ship in question. The name has quickly caught on, and is now used to classify a large number of off-book ship designs and styles of mostly unknown or unorthodox origins.

Epattcud is a name given to a variety of often pirate-constructed designs derived entirely or predominantly of scrap parts and materials.  

Due to the many issues with haphazardly slapping scrap plating and cheap flux cores onto even cheaper chassis, crew on ships like these are often required to wear atmosphere-sealed suits when venturing outside of their quarters and the bridge, as aside from these two sections of the ship, many areas are not fully flushed with atmosphere, and some are even left with blatant holes leading to outer space. 

These ships vary in almost every way, and can pose a threat, or a weak link in their fleet, depending on their loadout and hull specifications.

Some more adventurous pirate lords invest in the development of semi-intelligently-planned part-autofactory-built Epattcud designs, the result of which are far more effective and dangerous ships, which often wreak havoc on underprepared fleets.

The shadow it cast over the station is still etched into the minds of those who live there, and the destruction of the patrol fleets that tried to protect the docking ports has become a story often told in station bars on the fringe.

Rampant over-welding is often prevalent in this style of ship, due to how thin the armor plating is on the outmoded condor chassis; leading to an overextended, bulky, hard to maneuver hull that is easily overwhelmed in large engagements.

Monstrously large, these vessels are a pirate symbol of power, boasting the most valuable parts of the most expensive ships the pirates have been able to gut out and reform. When out of fuel, such ships are large enough to become a temporary pirate base until refueling endevours are undertaken, and their tactical prowess is only marginally sullied by absence of competent engine defense systems. Their frontal array is almost always spoken of as being bolstered by a number of ripped-out Onslaught TPC batteries, and reports of crew being blown out of maintenance decks by unexpected static mines are prevalent.

An old Hegemony design that had been thrown out for its inefficiency, there have been many attempts to re-tool the ship over the years, which eventually led to a blueprint redesign that included some rerouted flux to some light point-defence emplacements and a rickety missile mounting point fed directly from the cargo holds, which now keep it relevant amidst the slough of other pirate ships of better maneuverability and stature.

While the initial blueprints do in fact include a shield generator, the shield was incredibly inefficient to run due to the complex micro-adjustments required to project through several layers of poorly-attached scaffolded station plating, seeing this, the designers decided to remove it from the design, effectively rendering it shieldless as even installing a modular shield is nigh impossible due to the incredible flux stress. Despite this, the “Caldera” is able to project its ordnance with potency thanks to an improvised weapons clamp system installed onto its mounts.

Pirates have altered this clear “mistake” of a ship design to have functional weapons emplacements and reasonably competent engines, and often run this in their larger fleets. Crew on such a ship are instructed to migrate to the back of the ship during combat, as the front is used as a large gun platform and armor emplacement and has a tendency to fall off when faced with heavy fire.

To mitigate the erroneous features of this design, a combat rated ammofeeder system has been installed on the front of the ship, and an array of small annihilator tubes have been rigged to fire through small ports on the front on the vessel; though these alterations are notably unstable and ill advised.

In this case, it appears some design chips for the two segments of an Epattcud VI Warship otherwise nicknamed as “Mitigator” warships, have been reconstructed and improved in-software and manufactured as a single piece from one chip, with massive improvements across the board to the previously already functional design. Engine substrata have been realigned and compressed to make space for a simmilar Mass-Driver system seen built on the uncommon “Colatlus” pirate capital. 

“Epattcud VI” is the name assigned to the warship of unknown origins that covered the pirate assault of Arcadia; little is known of its specifications, though it is thought to be made of mostly nanoforged or autofactory-constructed parts, assembled in two different sections, then joined together to form a full capital ship. The shadow it cast over the station is still etched into the minds of those who live there, and the destruction of the patrol fleets that tried to protect the docking ports has become a story often told in station bars on the fringe. The Hegemony response fleet sent from Corvus arrived to find a terrified populace, panicking amidst a raided station and gutted fuel storage, and has since issued a system warning code specifically for this ship.
