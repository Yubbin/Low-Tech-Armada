Reclaimed Advanced Targeting Core,reclaimedadvancedcore,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.ReclaimedAdvancedTargetingCore,"Throughout this ship there are signs of an extensive data-wire system hidden behind internal plating, tracing back to a Paragon's ripped out and repurposed Advanced Targeting Core.
The Ship is too large to receive the full benefit from the already strained core, but it has been directed to focus more of its processing capabilities into assisting point defense weaponry than it otherwise would,
reducing  the range defecit such weapons receive.

Extends the range of ballistic and energy weapons by %s. The range of point-defense weapons is only extended by %s.

Reckless Engineering,recklessengineering,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.RecklessEngineering,"This hull's systems have been recklessly modified and extended, parts of dozens of different ships litter the hull, creating flux coil imbalances and inconsistent power lines, sacrificing nearly everything in exchange for enabling a highly unstable, extremely unsafe amelioration of the ships systems, likely without certified engineering oversight. 

Its systems appear to work correctly under routine conditions, but have a significant chance of critical malfunction when stressed.

Patchwork Heavy Ballistics Integration,PatchworkBallisticsIntegration,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.scripts.hullmods.PatchworkBallisticsIntegration,"Engineers have attempted to aid in the utilization of this hull's large weapons emplacement and only partially succeeded, with various sizes of ammo lines linked in a complicated, low-performance array that takes a long time to filter in shells. Despite this it is still capable of taking on nearly any heavy ballistic weapon, making it far less overwhelming to work with as a small crew, and as such the patchwork system has stuck.

Retrofitted Accelerators,RetrofittedAccelerators,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.scripts.hullmods.RetrofittedAccelerators,"This ship has been thoroughly 'overhauled' by its Pirate creators, retrofitted with an array of flux accelerators and ammo feeders.
This somewhat miraculously has produced affable results, increasing the firing clock speed for projectile weapons on board by %s.

Along with these benefits, makeshift armor rigging has been attached to various high-flux and high-heat components, reducing the sensor profile of the ship by %s and increasing the durability of engine machinery by %s.

Unfortunately, integrating nearly any Ballistic or Energy weapon into these systems is a nightmare, making weapons installations %s/%s/%s more expensive.","Increases the ordnance point cost of all weapons.

Improvised Shield Hardeners,improvisedshieldimprovements,,,,,,,,TRUE,,0,0,0,0,data.hullmods.ImprovisedShieldImprovements,"The shield generator on this module has been altered extensively, with vast layers of flux dampeners coating it in an almost incoherent lattice, sprouting cabling that spans the predominance of the interior space.

The disorderly and expansive sprawl of wiring and fluxwork precludes the installation of any additional shield modifications.
